<h2>About</h2>

Young self-taught computer programmer. Interested in computer science and sometimes cryptography. Windows lover at heart.

I began programming at an early age, first starting off with <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>. Now, I continue to teach myself more languages, occasionally reading a book here and there, and reading up on the latest news.
